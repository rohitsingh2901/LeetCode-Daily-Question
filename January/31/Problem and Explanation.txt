739. Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.


Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100


Explanation:
We will use a stack to resolve the problem.

1. Stack Management:
If the stack is empty or the temperature at the current index is warmer than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, we push the current index onto the stack.
If the temperature at the current index is not warmer, we pop indices from the stack until we find a warmer temperature or the stack becomes empty.
2. Calculate Waiting Days:
For each index encountered, if the stack becomes empty, it means there's no future warmer day. Otherwise, we calculate the number of days between the current index and the index at the top of the stack.
