1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
0 <= Node.val <= 105




Explanation:

1. Class Definition:
   - You've defined a class named "Solution".

2. Member Function: "maxAncestorDiff"
   - This function takes a "TreeNode*" pointer as its argument, representing the root of a binary tree.
   - It also takes two additional parameters with default values: "maxValue" and "minValue". These parameters are used to keep track of the maximum and minimum values encountered so far on the path from the root to the current node.
   - The function returns an integer, which represents the maximum difference between ancestor nodes.

3. Recursive Approach:
   - The function starts with a base case: if the current node is "nullptr" (indicating an empty subtree), it returns the calculated difference between "maxValue" and "minValue".
   - Otherwise, it updates "maxValue" and "minValue" based on the value of the current node.
   - The function then makes recursive calls for the left and right subtrees and returns the maximum value among the results of these recursive calls.

4. Base Case:
   - The base case ensures that the recursion stops when it reaches the leaves of the tree (null nodes).

5. Updating Max and Min Values:
   - At each step, the "maxValue" is updated with the maximum value encountered so far on the path.
   - Similarly, the "minValue" is updated with the minimum value encountered.

6. Returning Maximum Difference:
   - The final result is the maximum value among the differences calculated for the left subtree, right subtree, and the current subtree.

7. Default Parameter Values:
   - The default values for "maxValue" and "minValue" are set to "1e9" and "-1e9", respectively. These values are chosen to ensure that any valid node value will update these limits in the first step.
