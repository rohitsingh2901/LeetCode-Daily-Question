1291. Sequential Digits

An integer has sequential digits if and only if each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

Return a sorted list of all the integers in the range [low, high] inclusive that have sequential digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 100, high = 300
Output: [123,234]
Example 2:

Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
Output: [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]
 

Constraints:

10 <= low <= high <= 10^9

Explanation:

1. Initialization: 
    - A queue "q" is initialized to store the sequential digits.
    - The numbers from 1 to 9 are pushed into the queue initially.

2. Generation of Sequential Digits: 
    - Inside the while loop, a number "num" is dequeued from the front of the queue.
    - If the dequeued number "num" falls within the range "[low, high]", it is added to the result vector "ans".

3. Breaking Condition: 
    - If the dequeued number "num" exceeds the upper limit "high", the loop breaks.

4. Appending Next Sequential Digits: 
    - If the last digit of the dequeued number "num" is less than 9, the next sequential digit is generated by appending "(num * 10 + last_digit + 1)" to the queue. This is done to maintain the condition where each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

5. Return: 
    - Finally, the vector "ans" containing sequential digits within the range "[low, high]" is returned.
