2402. Meeting Rooms III

You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1. 
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= meetings.length <= 105
meetings[i].length == 2
0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 105
All the values of starti are unique.


Explanation:

1. The `mostBooked` function takes an integer `n` representing the number of rooms and a vector of vectors `meetings`, where each inner vector represents a meeting with its start and end times.

2. It sorts the meetings based on their start times.

3. It initializes a vector `count` to keep track of the number of meetings in each room and a vector `freeR` to represent the availability of rooms.

4. It initializes a priority queue `freeRoom` with the available rooms.

5. It initializes a priority queue `used` to keep track of the meetings that are currently ongoing in each room.

6. It iterates through each meeting in the sorted order.

7. For each meeting, it checks if there are any ongoing meetings that have ended before the current meeting starts. If so, it frees up those rooms by adding them back to the `freeRoom` priority queue.

8. It then determines the room for the current meeting. If there are no available rooms, it selects the room with the earliest ending meeting. Otherwise, it selects an available room.

9. It updates the count of meetings in the selected room, calculates the end time of the current meeting, and adds the meeting to the `used` priority queue.

10. Finally, it finds the room with the maximum number of meetings and returns its index.
